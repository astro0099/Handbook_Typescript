# The New TypeScript Handbook: A Guide to This Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the New TypeScript Handbook! Completely rewritten in 2019, this guide is a fresh take on TypeScript's original handbook that uses a new structure and workflow.
We've also rearranged the content and flow to better represent how users should think about TypeScript.

The New Handbook starts with a customized introduction depending on the reader's background.
The purpose of these introductions is to "set the table" by highlighting how TypeScript is similar or different to the reader's existing mental models.
All introductions eventually end on the first walkthrough module.
We recommend choosing the introduction that best describes you, or you may skip them entirely if you'd like.

The main articles of the Handbook are organized so that you can read it *in order*.
In other words, each chapter will only use concepts you've already been introduced to (or should recognize from normal JavaScript).

## Background Reading

The TypeScript Handbook isn't intended to be a replacement guide for learning JavaScript.
Throughout the content, you'll see links to recommended "Background Reading" pages (typically from the excellent Mozilla Developer Network).
We'll assume that you're familiar with basic concepts from those background readings.

## Expectations

You should expect each chapter or page to provide you with a strong understanding of the given concepts. The TypeScript Handbook is not a complete language specification, but it is intended to be a comprehensive guide to all of the language's features and behaviors.

A reader who completes the walkthrough should be able to:
 * Read and understand commonly-used TypeScript syntax and patterns
 * Explain the effects of important compiler options
 * Correctly predict type system behavior in most cases
 * Write a `.d.ts` declaration for a simple function, object, or class

In the interests of clarity and brevity, the main content of the Handbook will not explore every edge case or minutae of the features being covered.
You can find more details on particular concepts in the reference articles.

## Reference Articles

In addition to the walkthrough, we'll also provide *reference articles* which provide in-depth, technical explanations of concepts.
These articles are intended for advanced users who want to dive deep on particular aspects on TypeScript.
Reference articles will assume familiarity with all parts of JavaScript and TypeScript, so they might be a bit overwhelming for new users - don't worry if you don't understand everything in a reference article at first.
