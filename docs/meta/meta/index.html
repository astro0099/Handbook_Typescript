<h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</h2></a>
<p>Welcome to the New TypeScript Handbook! Completely rewritten in late 2018, this guide is a fresh take on TypeScript's original handbook that uses a new structure and workflow. We've also rearranged the content and flow to better represent how users should think about TypeScript.</p>
<p>The New Handbook starts with a customized introduction depending on the reader's background.
The purpose of these introductions is to "set the table" by highlighting how TypeScript is similar or different to the reader's existing mental models.
All introductions eventually end on the first walkthrough module.
We recommend choosing the introduction that best describes you, or you may skip them entirely if you'd like.</p>
<h2 id="expectations"><a href="#expectations">Expectations</h2></a>
<p>You should expect each chapter or page to provide you with a strong understanding of the given concepts. The TypeScript Handbook is not a complete language specification, but it is intended to be a comprehensive guide to all of the language's features and behaviors.</p>
<p>A reader who completes the walkthrough should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read and understand commonly-used TypeScript syntax and patterns</li>
<li>Explain the effects of common compiler options</li>
<li>Correctly predict type system behavior in most cases</li>
<li>Write a <code>.d.ts</code> declaration for a simple function, object, or class</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reference-articles"><a href="#reference-articles">Reference Articles</h2></a>
<p>In addition to the walkthrough, we'll also provide <em>reference articles</em> which provide in-depth, technical explanations of concepts.
There is not a 1:1 correspondence between walkthrough pages and reference articles.</p>
