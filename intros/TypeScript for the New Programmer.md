# TypeScript for the New Programmer

Congratulations choosing TypeScript as one of your first languages - you're already making good decisions.

You've probably already heard that TypeScript is a "flavor" or "variant" of JavaScript.
The relationship between TypeScript and JavaScript is rather unique among modern programming languages, so learning more about this relationship will help you understand how TypeScript adds to JavaScript.

## What is JavaScript? A Brief History

JavaScript started as a scripting language available in browers.
When the language was first invented, writing more than a few dozen lines of JavaScript (JS) in a webpage would have been somewhat unusual.
Over time, though, JS became more common and web developers used more and more JS in their webpages to enhance (usually!) the reader's experience.
Early web browsers executed JS very slowly and this led to laggy, unresponsive pages.

Web browser developers saw the increased use of JS and 
On modern websites, you might be running tens or even hundreds of thousands of lines of JS code.


As websites have grown more complex and turned in to web *applications*, the language has 

Lately, JavaScript has also become
